# climcaps_ak

Tools for manipulating CLIMCAPS averaging kernels

This project is a work in progress, expect changes.

## Test data

To download the two test granules, run the data_download.sh script in the top directory. This is a copy of an automatically created NASA Earthdata download script. Use your NASA Earth data login ID when prompted. The script will download two CLIMCAPS granules and copy them into the test_data subdorectory.


## IDL code

To run the hardcoded tests, run the script example.pro. (From an IDL prompt, run the command '@example.pro' while inside the idl subdirectory.) This will run the AK calculation for two test cases, for the temperature, water vapor and CO2 profiles.


## Python code

TBD
